### Fractional and the 0-1 Knapsack scenario

These two algorithms take a list of items where each item has a weight property
and a total benefit property. The goal is to find what combination of items can
fit inside of our "knapsack", with the constraint that the combined items must
have a total weight of less than or equal to the weight that the knapsack can
hold, given with the list of items. The difference between the two functions
is that the fractional algorithm is allowed to take parts of each item where the
0-1 must take the entirety of an item.

Extended descriptions of each program is contained in the comments of each.
