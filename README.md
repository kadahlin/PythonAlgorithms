### Algorithms in Python

Several algorithms that were presented in my analysis of algorithms class at the University of California, Irvine. I chose to implement these in Python as
I felt it was very useful for creating working examples that are easily readable. Descriptions of each one are in the comments section of their respective files. For algorithms that operate on a set of points I chose to structure those input files with each line being a point, and each coordinate in that point separated by a tab character.
